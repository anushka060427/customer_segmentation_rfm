# customer_segmentation_rfm
Customer segmentation using RFM analysis and K-Means clustering

This project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on their transactional behavior.
Clusters : 
The K-Means clustering algorithm identified 3 distinct customer segments:

- Cluster 0: Description of Cluster 0 (e.g., loyal customers with high frequency and monetary value)
- Cluster 1: Description of Cluster 1 (e.g., at-risk customers with low recency and frequency)
- Cluster 2: Description of Cluster 2 (e.g., new customers with high recency and low frequency)

Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling
2. RFM Analysis: Calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores for each customer
3. K-Means Clustering: Applied K-Means clustering to RFM scores to identify customer segments

Insights and Recommendations
- Cluster 0: Insights and recommendations for Cluster 0 (e.g., offer loyalty rewards and personalized offers)
- Cluster 1: Insights and recommendations for Cluster 1 (e.g., win-back campaigns and special discounts)
- Cluster 2: Insights and recommendations for Cluster 2 (e.g., welcome offers and introductory discounts)

Code and Dependencies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn libraries for EDA and model preparation. 
- Matplotlib and seaborn libraries for data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and visualization.
